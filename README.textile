h1. GIT-PHP

For those times when loading a local "github" instance in php would be nice.

h2. Installation

Drop it in a directory, point a virtualhost at the @web@ folder, and off you go. This is assuming you have Apache as a server.

You may need to tweak the settings a bit, they are in @config/core.php@. I will document these when I have completed the app, as the configuration interface may change drastically between now and then. Hopefully it is self-explanatory though.
